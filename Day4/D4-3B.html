            <p>Doomed. We're all doomed. You set the example and created a habit. Now we're all used to and ready to forever leave our code full of comments. Old versions, with confusing tags.</p>

            <p>Years later, not one member of the team can hold a job. Why? Their codes are a mess. A jumble of commented old versions, commits and changes. Not one other user can make heads or tails of their code.</p>

            <p>See that city? Dark, and gloomy. That's the future you've doomed us all to. Are you happy now? You, and your lack of GIT etiquette? Tsk Tsk Tsk.</p>

            <h2>Wow!</h2>
            <p>What a beautiful day today. It helps your mood, after a long week of trying to get your project up to code.</p>

            <p>Basking in the sunshine, you arrive at the campus, full of fresh, happy energy. All is well!</p>

            <p>Of course, that all changes. As you walk in, through the glass wall, you notice your teammates standing around one laptop, staring and scratching their heads.</p>

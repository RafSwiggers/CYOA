# CYOA: Your week at Becode

## Summary

### Goal
This week's project is to both study the curriculum, or part of it, more in-depth, and to make an actionable project that shows this in-depth knowledge. 

To both show actual usage of html as well as make the project inclusive to all the chapters we've seen so far, I've decided to make a short "choose your own adventure" game.

#### Plot
The player takes on the role of a fictional newcomer to the becode group. Each day, they meet another member of the group, struggling with a part of the curriculum. 

The five days give us the opportunity for five separate "lessons". If time permits, I would like to add several endings, depending on who gets helped, and who gets a wrong answer.

Regardless of the answer, the person receiving help reacts with kindness and gratitude. Wether or not the problem is solved won't be known until the end.

#### Storyboard
In order to keep the layout in HTML. THis would require a rather large amount of pages, each one representing the choices made before. This isn't too hard in the end, though it would require copious amounts of copy and paste.

Ideally, the ending would be friday evening, where the after-hours drink is attended by the people helped out. Those provided with the wrong answer are comically sad and coping poorly.

#### Resources
Mostly HTML and CSS. Images and gifs for the pages and dialogue, and probably a simple template for the basic design.

#### Pages
I've tallied the pages, endings and steps in between. I'll need several versions of every page, identical, for every level. In total, I'll have 63 pages.

I'll need to write 5 days and 63 endings. Luckily, most endings will be modular. If I knew a bit more Javascript, I could incorporate this. Given the timeframe, I'm not confident in my ability to pull that off though.

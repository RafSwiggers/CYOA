# CYOA: Your week at Becode

## Summary

### Goal
This week's project is to both study the curriculum, or part of it, more in-depth, and to make an actionable project that shows this in-depth knowledge. 

To both show actual usage of html as well as make the project inclusive to all the chapters we've seen so far, I've decided to make a short "choose your own adventure" game.

#### Plot
The player takes on the role of a fictional newcomer to the becode group. Each day, they meet another member of the group, struggling with a part of the curriculum. 

The five days give us the opportunity for five separate "lessons". If time permits, I would like to add several endings, depending on who gets helped, and who gets a wrong answer.

Regardless of the answer, the person receiving help reacts with kindness and gratitude. Wether or not the problem is solved won't be known until the end.

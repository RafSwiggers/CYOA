# CYOA: Your week at Becode

## Summary

### Goal
This week's project is to both study the curriculum, or part of it, more in-depth, and to make an actionable project that shows this in-depth knowledge. 

To both show actual usage of html as well as make the project inclusive to all the chapters we've seen so far, I've decided to make a short "choose your own adventure" game.

#### Plot
The player takes on the role of a fictional newcomer to the becode group. Each day, they meet another member of the group, struggling with a part of the curriculum. 

The five days give us the opportunity for five separate "lessons". If time permits, I would like to add several endings, depending on who gets helped, and who gets a wrong answer.

##### Monday
On monday, the player meets Jasmine. Her worries lie with the HTML. She shows the user some code, that is missing a closing tag. If the player notices the closing tag, he helps her out. If not, they move on.

Regardless of the player's answer, Jasmine responds enthusiastically. Wether or not the problem is solved won't be known until the end.

##### Tuesday

Tuesday is when we meet Steve. He's concerned his website isn't entirely looking as it should. The positioning is driving him crazy, even though he's using grid. He shows a layout divided into grid areas. He's been using id's and classes wrong, making the layout and design all over the place.

No matter the answer, Steve responds with kindness and gratitude. Wether or not the problem is solved won't be known until the end.

##### Wednesday
On wednesday, we find Panadda stuck in SASS. Their changes just aren't pushing through. We find out they haven't set their file to be watched, so the changes aren't being turned into an actual stylesheet. 

Regardless of the answer, Panadda reacts with kindness and gratitude. Wether or not the problem is solved won't be known until the end.

##### Friday

            <h3>You made it! It's Friday!</h3>
            <p>You spend the day fine-tuning and polishing your project. The last few inches of layout and postioning. A final image resize. One more lighthouse test.</p>

            <p>It's done. And not only is it done, your fellow developers are all quite cheerful. You may not have had all the answers, but you were there, looking for one with them.</p>

            <p>Standing together against a week of minor issues was truly what being a developer is about. It's not knowing all the answers. It's being able to find them.</p>

            <p>I hope you had fun. I hope you learned something. I hope your next project goes so smooth you'll wonder what you needed a 7 month course for.</p>

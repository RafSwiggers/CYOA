            <p> As soon as the words leave your lips, it seems a long, sullen silence falls over the class. A coach, in his infinite wisdom, walks over to you slowly. "That" he says "is an list tag. They don't have an order. It's her H2 tag. It wasn't closed."</p>
            <p>You spend the rest of the day studying up on tags, and what they do. It seems a small sign somewhere can make a huge difference.</p>

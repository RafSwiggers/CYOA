            <h2>"SASS!" She cries out.</h2>
            <p>You cock an eyebrow and look at her in wonder. "Someone is giving you sass? Like... an attitude?" She looks at you rather sharply.</p>

            <p>"No!" she comes back. "My Sass is giving me attitude! I keep trying to do my styling in Sass, but nothing is happening!"</p>

            <p>As usual, you're there to help. You ask her to take you through the process. She does. She gives you the following.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I start up the SASS stylesheet</li>
                <li>I make a css stylesheet with the same name.</li>
                <li>I link the css stylesheet in the html file.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"What's going wrong here? What am I missing?</p>

            <ul class="actions stacked">
                <li><a href="/CYOA/Day1/D1-2.html" class="button">Maybe just stick to CSS?</a></li>

# Problems

## Monday
On monday, the player meets Jasmine. Her worries lie with the HTML. She shows the user some code, that is missing a closing tag. If the player notices the closing tag, he helps her out. 

Answer A: "You missed a closing tag for this "p".
Answer B: "Looks fine to me!".

## Tuesday
Tuesday is when we meet Steve. He's concerned his website isn't entirely looking as it should. He's made some design choices that just aren't showing up. Using classes, we can divide the stylings properly, rather than override them every time.

Answer A: "Man, I hope you find a fix. Have you tried using !important?"
Answer B: "You seem to be styling a lot of similar elements every time. Maybe try classes, so they don't overwrite each other."

## Wednesday
On wednesday, we find Panadda stuck in SASS. Their changes just aren't pushing through. We find out they haven't set their file to be watched, so the changes aren't being turned into an actual stylesheet. 

Answer A: "Are you sure your SASS is being processed? Doesn't seem like you're starting that part of the process."
Answer B: "Hmm... Maybe you should just work in CSS? Doesn't seem worth the hassle."

## Thursday
Thursday is the day we run into an issue using GIT and GITHUB. When merging branches; there is a conflict. The player should indicate to remove one of the two versions in the code, including the tags.

Answer A: "Maybe just copy-paste your code into the master branch? Fix it that way."
Answer B: "You need to remove the code marked "master" or "head", including the tags. Pick one or the other."


## Ending
The big one. Each ending will have a good or bad module for each question answered over the week. The idea is to show the after-work drinks as a display of who was helped and who wasn't. Hooray!

            <h2>Monday</h2>
            <p>Oh, that monday feeling! Your head is still pounding a little bit from the weekend. The life of a web developer is a rough one. Work all day, party all night.</p>

            <p>But hey, you knew what you signed up for. You make your way to the glamorous Becode Campus, fresh caffeine pumping through your veins. Thank god you drink coffee, and not Nalu.</p>

            <p> You hop off the tram, and greet a few other students. The soft morning sun hits your face.</p>

            <p>You step into the lobby, cheerfully greeted by the lady at the reception desk. Before she can get up, you smile, and show her that you have a badge.</p>


            <ul class="actions stacked">
                <li><a href="#" class="button">Swipe your badge.</a></li>
            </ul>

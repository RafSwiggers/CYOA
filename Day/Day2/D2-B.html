            <h2>Tuesday, let's do this!</h2>
            <p>Table set, coffee poured, awesomeness brought! It's time to get your code on. You begin your day tapping away at your keyboard, building what is sure to be an experience the user will never forget! Or at least won't ignore on their Facebook
                feed.
            </p>

            <p>Over lunch, you see Steve starting at his screen. He asks you to take a look. Even though he's been styling things, his styling doesn't seem to carry over to his actual page. He kindly asks you to take a look at his CSS.</p>
